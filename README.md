<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;Auto Windows is a small and on-going project of a language inspired by the C, C++ and Autohotkey languages.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The Auto Windows Compiler, AWC for short, was made using the Python language, turning Auto Windows code into C++ code. All codes produced by this language use the Win32 API, being, by consequence, mainly supported on the Windows platform.</p>
