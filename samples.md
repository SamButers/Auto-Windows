<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;Some samples Auto Windows samples are available in the Github repository and a brief explanation will be given for the function of each one.</p>

## Factorial
<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;The factorial is a basic algorithm which reads a number as input and prints its factorial.</p>

## Send message
<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;The send message is a algorithm which reads an amount of time in milliseconds and then a string, and after the time given elapses after the string is given, it sends the given string as keyboard input followed by the enter key.</p>

## Conditions
<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;The conditions is a algorithm that tests if conditions are working as intended, expected to print "1234" if all comparisons happens as expected.</p>

## File reading
<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;The file reading algorithm opens the file "a.txt" in reading mode in the current directory and attempts to read two strings from it and then print them.</p>

## File writing
<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;The file reading algorithm opens or creates the file "test.txt" in writing mode in the current directory and attempts to write "This is a wonderful test." to it.</p>

## Move from area
<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;The move from area algorithm reads values for x0, y0, x1 and y1, and then moves the mouse away if the mouse is in the area described by the values given.</p>

## Image drawing
<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;The image drawing algorithm reads a choice from 1 to 3 of which image to draw, followed by the coordinates X and Y from where it will position the entire drawing to start the drawing process. The images are processed 1-bit indexed images saved as a .txt and the algorithm takes its executable is positioned in the root folder of the project. The ESC key can be pressed to stop the execution. A execution of the algorithm follows below:</p>
